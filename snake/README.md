# snake
A small attempt to make better use of my time by recreating the classic snake game in every language I know.
## C
Starting with C, the first language I learned. It currently supports Ncurses library on linux terminals, plans to port it to openGL for multiplatform support are on hold for now.
## C++
should be pretty close to C
## JAVA
for the future
## Python
for the future
## Javascript
I kinda dont want to do this one
## Android
technically not a language but should be interesting anyways
